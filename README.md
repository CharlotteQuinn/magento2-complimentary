# Creating work & Sign off process #

1. When creating new content in Magento please develop your changes in a code editor such as Sublime. This will help remove any code mistakes by identifying missing closing tags etc... 
2. When working in Sublime use the following packages to keep your code clean and tidy. This will help keep the code uniform and to our strict code syntax. (If you need help installing these, speak to Sam or Richard)
* CSS Format - [http://mutian.github.io/Sublime-CSS-Format/](http://mutian.github.io/Sublime-CSS-Format/ "CSS Format")
* HTML Beautify -  [https://github.com/rareyman/HTMLBeautify](https://github.com/rareyman/HTMLBeautify "HTML Beautify")
3. Once you've completed your first draft copy of your code, navigate to your Staging area and locate your page or block in Magento. Here you will be able to copy your code & test your code in this testing environment. This is to ensure there are no mishaps on the live selling website which could cause loss of earnings or inter fear with the customers buying experience. 
4. Now your code is live in staging you will now have to get someone who knows HTML & CSS to sign off your work. This is a vital step when setting new content changes live. Code cannot be set live without it being checked by another member of the team. These checks are needed when you make any changed to HTML or CSS in a block or a page in Magento. 
5. Once your code is signed off you can then publish it to the live selling site. Please make sure to make backups of the old code. These can be added to a github folder or in a shared drive. This is to ensure we have backups for when things go wrong.
